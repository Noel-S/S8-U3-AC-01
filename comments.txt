State and State Management:
The app has two main screens: Home and Auth, both of which are stateful widgets. This indicates that the state of these screens may change during their lifecycle.

setState is used in _HomeState to change the user state after getting arguments from the route.
Navigation and Passing Data:
The app uses Navigator.pushReplacementNamed() for navigation which means it's replacing the current screen with the new one, making it impossible to navigate back to the previous screen using the back button.
Data is passed between routes using the arguments parameter in the navigation. The Home screen expects a String argument which represents the user's name.
Form Validation:
In the Auth screen, there is a form with two TextFormField widgets. These fields are validated using the validator property which returns a feedback message if the input doesn't match the expected values (_user and _password).

Custom UI Interactions:
There is a ValueListenableBuilder wrapped around the password TextFormField in the Auth screen. This allows the app to rebuild only the password field based on changes to the _showPasswordNotifier ValueNotifier, giving the user the ability to toggle password visibility.
The app also uses dialogs (AlertDialog) to provide feedback to the user during login/logout operations.

Theming and Styling:
The application defines a custom theme in the MyApp widget. Specifically, the InputDecorationTheme is customized to have an OutlineInputBorder with rounded corners.
The ColorScheme.fromSeed() method is used to generate a color scheme based on a seed color, which in this case is Colors.deepPurple.
